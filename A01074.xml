            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2681:4"/> places. These people are very like bad Phisitions, who professe great cunning in healing other mens mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but are farre vnable to cure themselues. They would heale vs (whom they call <hi>Babylon</hi>) themselues being blind and vnskilfull in their owne grieuous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of pride and confusion. Oh (say they) happie were the inhabitants of this land, and more happie were the Rulers and Teachers, if they were members of the true, that is (as they call it) of their separated congregation. Twice happie should the people of <hi>England,</hi> and other countries be, if once they would worship God, according to his word with vs that are separate, abdicate and abiured.

            <p>Wherfore they cry out against our Church, holding it to be false and adulterate, <hi>Antichristian, Babylonish,</hi> and <hi>Romes</hi> sister.

For which cause, that with more craft and speed, they may inueigle the vnletterd, ignorant, yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and weake ones with their <hi>Syrene songs,</hi> &amp; sweete baites, vnto their faction, they abuse our Lords words

            <p>All these, the eyes of your Maiestie do behold, and your eye-lids do consider, that they are in the gall of bitternesse, and wrapped in iniquity: all these Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies (I meane) who iustifie their owne assemblies, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowing, scoffing, and deriding ours, as meerly false, meretricious, Babylonish and Antichristian. These mockers do call (the booke of <hi>Common prayer</hi>) a peece of swines flesh, spitting at it and despising it as a thing most vncleane and abhominable. The bookes of the holy Bible, of the old and new Testament, which are yearly or oftner read through in our congregations (because they are set forth some for one time, &amp; some for another, to be read in order and course) they say they are read by patches and peeces, they are cut, rent, and violently torne, and applied superstitiously to dayes, feasts and times.</p>

That we should continually meditate, vpon these his two <hi>Aduents</hi> and commings, ruminating and weighing in our hearts, how much he hath performed by his former, and how much he hath promised to do for vs at the latter.</p>
               <p>But you will say to me, that <hi>Bernard saw not all things:</hi> Wherefore I pray you hearken diligently, vnto that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of the Fathers S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> There was no cause (saith he) of the <hi>Aduent</hi> of our Lord Iesus Christ, but to saue poore sinners.

Because all mankind was lost after one had transgressed, in whom all mankind was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and tooke their originall. Therfore came one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, who saued all beleeuers, by his righteousnesse, which was without staine of sinne.

               <p>Howbeit some contradicting spirit, will yet obiect and say: I yeeld to all this, what then? Can it thereupon be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and concluded, that other Sondayes and Holidaies must also be obserued, as you do keepe them?

The words whereupon he writes are these. <hi>(This is the day, which the Lord hath made, let vs reioyce and be glad in it.)</hi> That which he writeth hereupon is this.</p>
               <p>Albeit (saith he) tis true, that all dayes were alike created of God; yet <hi>Dauid</hi> by a certaine eminencie, and excellency, cals it a diuine day, or a day which the diuine Creator hath made, and set apart, which after a long time of darknesse, shone and gaue light for the Churches good; because that day was principally noted and obserued, and vnto posterity a day most memorable.</p>
               <p>Was this lawfull and expedient in the time of the Law? It well beseemed, and befitted king <hi>Dauid,</hi> the type and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, who figured our Christ.

               <p>The holy Angel of the Lord, vpon the very day of Christs birth, tooke a text concerning Christs birth, and preached thereupon vnto the Shepheards. Why should not all good Bishops, Pastors, Teachers, and all other Ministers and mēbers of Christs holy Church, yeeld &amp; performe the same?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>And forthwith, there was with the Angell</hi> (saith S. <hi>Luke) a multitude of heauenly souldiers, praysing God, and saying: Glory to God in the highest, peace in the earth, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards men.</hi> The quiers of the holy Angels did keepe and celebrate this blessed day, of that new borne Babe: they talke of the deeds and effects thereof, in their Sermon and in their song.

Why should not other holy men and women do also the same? vnlesse they will staine themselues with the tincture and pollution of most lothsome ingratitude, and proofe of all Gods creatures, and of all that professe religion, the most vnthankfull.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2681:10"/>
               <p>Lastly, the reformed Churches (to speake but one word more) who vnto them and vs may in this case be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither do now, or euer did deny, the keeping of these and other dayes and feasts. The which may appeare, both by the Sermons, workes, words and practise, of the most orthodoxe Ministers, and may be seene also, by the decrees &amp; constitutions, of national and prouincial synodes; as also, out of that <hi>Harmony of Confessions of the reformed Churches,</hi> the 16. Section.</p>
               <p>Methinkes then, that men should not carry themselues, so rudely and vncharitably, or to open their mouths, so wide and vnreuerently, against their mother the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (and all other godly reformed Churches in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) as do the factious sectaries, or <hi>Anabaptisticall Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,</hi> who giue out in their libels and contentious pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, <hi>that the celebration of Aduent, the feast of the Natiuitie of Christ, of Easter, of Christs Ascension,</hi> and the <hi>feast of Pentecost,</hi> is either <hi>Iewish,</hi> or <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Popish.</hi> For if they, or any other such greene heads were not, some of them selfe-conceited, some hood-winked, others wilfully blind and deafe, they might easily heare, and most cleerly see by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and combining the sacred Scriptures of the Old and New Testament together, culled out by the Church for these purposes, as also by that generall connexion and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall coincidence, and consequence one vpon another, that their opinion, as it is very erroneous: so is it vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and themselues very dangerous.</p>
               <p>But to leaue them, and to come to our selues (which are of another mind) that we may proceed in our intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: Let vs behold and consider, the choice that is made, for this first Sonday in <hi>Aduent,</hi> which is very singular, most effectuall, and to very good purpose, as seruing to front all the <hi>Aduent Sondaies,</hi> yea and all the rest of the <hi>Sondaies,</hi> in the yeare.</p>

               <p>The Vnity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Vnity which,<note place="margin">Trinity Sōday The 25. Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes after Trinity,</note> is to be worshipped, cannot bee remembred: and therefore some scriptures are also appointed for the commemoration and celebration of that most diuine and sacred mystery, not onely vpon that day which is called <hi>Trinitie Sonday,</hi> but also for fiue and twenty Sondaies after: Wherein, as vpon this day, the doctrines concerning the mystery of this indiuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Trinity, are handled: So for the twenty fiue Sondaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this feast, (which make vp the other halfe yeare,) they haue selected such texts of holy scripture, as may most fitly stand Gods people in stead for doctrines and exhortations, vnto the bringing forth of the fruites of the spirit, and to the hatred and detestation of the workes of the flesh.</p>
